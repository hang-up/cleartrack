# Cleartrack backend

This is the backend for the Cleartrack project. It uses Supabase as the underlying development platform, combining a PostgreSQL database with a RESTful API, authentication, and edge-triggered functions.

## Getting started
```bash
# Install supabase: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started?queryGroups=platform&platform=macos#running-supabase-locally

supabase start
```
